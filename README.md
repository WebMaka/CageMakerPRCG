Quickly create a 3D-printable object file for a rack cage for any device of a given size. Simply provide the device's dimensions, and optionally tweak a few settings, then press F6 then F7 to generate and save a STL file.

## Cagemaker PRCG + OpenSCAD Playground

I'm happy to announce that CageMaker PRCG is now available in a fork of the Java-based OpenSCAD port [OpenSCAD Playground](https://github.com/openscad/openscad-playground). This allows using CageMaker PRCG right from a web browser without having to install any additional software. The full feature set of CageMaker PRGC is available, and Playground can even export completed STL files for slicing and printing.

Be sure to [check out the quick-start guide](https://github.com/WebMaka/CageMakerPRCG/blob/main/openscad_playground_quick_start_guide.md), or [jump over to the Playground and start creating cages](https://cagemaker.org/playground/).
